Big Fat Percussion Loops
Created by Matt Cooper – April 2014

Thank you for downloading “Big Fat Percussion Loops” from Crick Studios.  If you haven’t already, please comment on the Unity Asset Store download page as it really helps sell our other assets.

This pack contains 5 seamlessly looping percussion clips.  The tracks starting with “loop” will seamlessly repeat when dropped into Unity (don’t forget to check “loop” in the inspector).  

Each file name contains the bpm (beats per minute) of the loop in case you would like to sync game elements to the percussion.  Also included with the download is a version of each track with an ending.  Using a bit of scripting, these endings can kick in on the last play-through of the track, so that the percussion ends realistically instead of fading out.

I hope these tracks bring extra excitement to your game.  Be sure to check out the other Crick Studios assets on the Unity Asset Store!
